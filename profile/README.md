# UC Berkeley CS61B - Data Structures

Hi! This is the "staff" organization for CS 61B @ UC Berkeley.

## Public Access Resources

Previous course staff have made some iterations of this course available for
auditors -- both Berkeley students and members of the public. While the
assignment skeletons and specifications will be available for most years,
some assignments have autograders that are not public. The most recent version
with a public autograder is
[Spring 2021](https://sp21.datastructur.es/about.html#auditing-cs61b).

Here's lints to the relevant materials:

- [SP24 Course Website](https://sp24.datastructur.es)
- [Skeleton code](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp24)
- [Java Libraries](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/library-sp24)
  

## Tooling

61B uses some tools to run its course. These are the open-source ones that
we maintain for ourselves and actively use.

- [IntelliJ Plugin][plugin] - A style checker
- [Java Visualizer][] - An IntelliJ plugin to visualize the data layout in
  Java applications. Externally maintained.
- [jh61b][] - A JUnit executor to output test results in [Gradescope's format][]
- [BSAG][] - A Better SimpleAutograder for custom Gradescope logic
  - [bsag-jh61b] - BSAG steps for jh61b components
